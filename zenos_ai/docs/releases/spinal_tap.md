# Release Notes — 2026.11.0 'This Is Spinal Tap'

**Status:** In development (beta)
**Branch:** `feat/2026.11.0`
**Base:** 2026.10.1 (patch on 2026.10.0 'Tron')

---

## Summary

Security goes to eleven.

Tron made admission explicit and put a badge in every agent's hands. This release makes the badge matter, and puts locks on the cabinets behind it. FileCabinet holds identity state, component definitions, configuration, mounts and the material that becomes agent context, and its live drawers can invoke tools. Permission to change a drawer can change what the system later believes or does, so the drawer is the next boundary to enforce.

**Backstage passes for agents, locks on the cabinets, and a working screen for the show.**

## Planned Scope

**The goal:** no unadmitted agent reaches a protected drawer, while System bootstrap and recovery keep working.

**The chain:** Postman approves, CertAdmin admits, the enclave stores credentials, `zen_root_authentik` authenticates, Identity authorizes, and FileCabinet enforces. Where a call came from is recorded for audit and is never authority.

1. **Access-path audit.** Every way into a protected drawer is mapped before any enforcement lands: tool calls, mounts, live drawers, boot and repair paths.
2. **FileCabinet security.** One enforcement point. Read, write, protected configuration and cabinet administration are separate permissions. They cover listing, search, copies, moves, mounts, expansion and live-drawer dispatch. Authorization follows the resolved destination, and a cross-cabinet operation checks both sides. Following a mount confers no authority, so mount resolution happens before the access check. Callers see only what they may read: a hidden drawer is indistinguishable from one that does not exist. Effective inherited access can be shown per drawer.
3. **Trusted entry points.** System and Default Agent authority are separated. Flynn and the prompt loader are named trusted entry points, and there is no agent-selectable "system" bypass.
4. **Admission enforcement.** `zenos.agent.basic` stops being a badge that is requested and becomes one that is checked, through an admission-token contract with `zen_root_authentik`. A Postman approval is bound to the enrollment it was given for and cannot be replayed. Participation stays distinct from administrative authority.
5. **Bootstrap and recovery.** Flynn's cold boot, upgrade, revocation and recovery run on a trusted path, and each is proven.
6. **Audit-only rollout.** Enforcement ships first as would-deny logging, with a rollback, then turns on.
7. **Operator permission report.** Shows the resolved identity, granted capabilities, effective cabinet access and the reason an operation was denied. Secrets are excluded.

**FileCabinet interface cleanup.** The `action_type` field moves to `mode=` (with merge and replace behavior moving to `merge:`), and a compatibility shim carries existing callers. It follows the audit, because the audit maps the same callers.

**Also planned**
- Every tool guards its inputs (the contract sweep begun in 2026.10.1).
- One configure contract across plugin setup.
- Identity and Labels event-ordering hardening.
- Display, finished: the shared dashboard ships, interruption awareness covers the remaining Media Manager watch paths, and expiry and dismissal are tested against the real scheduler cadence.

**Later phase:** binding to the conversation or session. It needs its own design and acceptance criteria before it joins scope.

Order of work: audit, designs, audit-only mode, enforcement.

## Scope of the Claim

FileCabinet enforcement protects the ZenOS access boundary. Home Assistant administrators, and any path with direct access to the underlying state, remain part of the trusted platform.
