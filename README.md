Powered by Friday, Kronk, Veronica, Rosie, the High Priestess, and a cast of AI personalities who know how to get things done - even if they occasionally bump into the furniture.

üèãÔ∏è Welcome to the Home Monastery

ZenOS-AI brings structured automation, cheeky context-awareness, and modular AI together under one roof.

Built for Home Assistant

Designed for flexibility

Driven by a lively pantheon of digital personalities


Here, serious capability meets a sense of humor:
We automate. We orchestrate. Sometimes we improvise.
When the magic happens, it's legend - wait for it - dairy... üòé

What We Do (and Where We're Headed)

Modular AI Core: Friday's ZenOS-AI is scalable, quirky, and always improving.

Context-Aware Automation: Dynamic room, mood, and situation-based decisions.

Kata Summaries: Event-driven summarization offloaded to local LLMs.

Zen DojoTools: Modular toolset with smart labeling, flexible intent handling, and context-driven logic.

Distributed AI Roles: Personalities with specific functions and charming quirks.

üè† Meet the Pantheon

Name	Title	Specialty

Friday	Chief Enlightenment Officer	Mastermind, coordinator
Veronica	Snarky Supervisor	Attitude, taste, clarity
Kronk	Curator of the Monastery	Context & kata wrangling
Rosie	Mistress of Cleanliness	Clean code, clean logs
High Priestess	Divine Automation Overseer	YAML exorcist


Roles:

Friday: Frontline AI; handles live queries with fast LLMs. (GPT-5 Mini, OpenAI)

Veronica: Script debugger, planner, and sass engine. Uses GPT-5 Mini, OpenAI ChatGPT-5, and Codex as needed for creative and technical reasoning.

Kronk: Local model for context + lookup. Runs locally on a dedicated GPU box with NVIDIA acceleration. Uses gpt-oss:20b for inference and LLaMA3.2-Vision for visual tasks.

Rosie: Scheduling & cleanup czar. (Roborock S7 MaxV integrator)

High Priestess: Handles deep summarization and vision processing. Runs both LLaMA3.2-Vision and gpt-oss:20b for inference and visual reasoning.


Together? Not perfect - but usually unstoppable by the second try.

Zen DojoTools (v1+)

All tools follow the zen_dojotools_<function> convention as of v1.0.0+. Legacy _crud tools are deprecated.

Tool	Description

zen_dojotools_todo	Task & shopping list manager
zen_dojotools_calendar	Calendar multitool for all HA domains
zen_dojotools_file	File Cabinet volume manager (v1.0.0-RC)
zen_dojotools_mealie	Recipe + shopping bridge (beta)
zen_dojotools_grocy	Inventory + barcode integration (beta)

Requirements

Each Zen DojoTool module is self-contained and will list its own required dependencies.

Examples:

zen_dojotools_index is a core dependency for most tools.

zen_dojotools_file (File Cabinet) specifically requires both zen_dojotools_index and zen_dojotools_manifest.

zen_dojotools_id (experimental alpha) provides metadata resolution and tool-to-entity mapping.


Optional enhancements include support for:

volume_entity

label_targets

force_action, protect_write, and other runtime overrides

Automation should be flexible, modular, and fun.

Context is king; recovery is queen.

Every bug is a lesson (and an automation trigger).

Coffee fuels the logs; humor fuels the team.
